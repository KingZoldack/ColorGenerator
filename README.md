# ColorGenerator
The Color Generator Maui app enables users to interactively generate and explore colors through RGB sliders. The XAML layout employs a grid structure with sliders for the red, green, and blue components, providing users with real-time control over the color selection. A "Generate Random Color" button initiates the creation of a random color, updating the UI and sliders accordingly. The hex value of the selected color is prominently displayed, accompanied by a copy button for easy accessibility. The app's code-behind, implemented in C#, handles various functionalities, including color selection, random color generation, and clipboard interaction for copying hex values. Additionally, the app exhibits responsiveness by adjusting its layout for the WinUI platform.
